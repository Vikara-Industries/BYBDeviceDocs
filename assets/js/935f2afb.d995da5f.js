No thrills. Just neuroscience. If you are a student or an amateur scientist yearning to get your start in neuroscience, this is for you. Perhaps you\'re a teacher in need of an affordable, exciting, and in-depth educational tool to make learning neuroscience fun for kids or young adults. You could even be looking for a competition-destroying science fair project. Whatever your neuroscience need, the Neuron Spikerbox Classic is here to fill it! The Neuron SpikerBox is a bioamplifier that allows you to hear and see real-time electrical \\"spikes\\", or action potentials, of live neurons in invertebrates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Insect/NSBpro/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Insect/NSBpro/index","title":"Neuron SpikerBox Pro","description":"|Technical Specifications||","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Insect/Roboroach/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Insect/Roboroach/index","title":"The RoboRoach","description":"Please Note: Requires at least one Cockroach","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Plant/PlantSpikerBox/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Plant/PlantSpikerBox/index","title":"Plant SpikerBox","description":"Our Plant Spikerbox allows you to perform data-driven experiments between various species of plants!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/index","title":"Spike Recorder","description":"Our devices are ment to be used with our Spike Recorder Software available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRAndroid/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRAndroid/index","title":"index","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRiOS/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRiOS/index","title":"index","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRPC/index":{"id":"devices/devices/Software/SpikeRecorder/SRPC/index","title":"index","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"experiments/experiments/Engineering/Transistors/index":{"id":"experiments/experiments/Engineering/Transistors/index","title":"Background: Transistor Theory","description":"Ahh yes, the transistor.

But what about yourself? Your body uses electricity to communicate and control parts of the body. Though all cells have ionic gradients across their membranes, the most well known organ systems that use electricity are the brain, the muscles, and the heart.","sidebar":"experimentsSidebar"},"experiments/experiments/index":{"id":"experiments/experiments/index","title":"Experiments","description":"Welcome to the Backyard Brains experiments page for scientists, teachers and amateurs alike. Below you will find all of our open source experiments, lesson plans and useful information. If you\'re looking for a science fair project, several of our experiments come with suggestions. If you are an educator, you may be interested in what Educational Standards our lesson plans adhere too. Additionally, we list which specific standards are being met at the bottom of each lesson plan. For teachers interested in our experiments, check out our Teacher\'s Guides section!","sidebar":"experimentsSidebar"},"experiments/experiments/Insect/NeuronSpikerBox/index":{"id":"experiments/experiments/Insect/NeuronSpikerBox/index","title":"Experiment: Record and Manipulate Live Neurons!","description":"Did you just get a SpikerBox, and are wondering how to use it? In this lesson, you will listen to action potentials and view \\"spikes\\" in real time. This is an excellent starting point for your SpikerBox as well as a great nervous system lab for students as young as middle school! See live action potentials in an engaging lab activity!","sidebar":"experimentsSidebar"},"experiments/experiments/Plant/Flytrap/index":{"id":"experiments/experiments/Plant/Flytrap/index","title":"Getting Started with the Plant SpikerBox: Venus Flytrap Electrophysiology","description":"Electrical impulses are not only relegated to the hearts, muscles, and brains of animals.
