Your brain commands your movements by sending electrical signals down axons to your muscles. The HHI works by reading these electrical signals from YOUR brain and sending a copy to command THEIR muscles. That\'s right: you can send your brain\'s signals over to another person\'s arm, effectively overriding their own nervous system!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devicesmd/HumanSpikerBox":{"id":"devicesmd/HumanSpikerBox","title":"Human SpikerBox","description":"One box to rule them all!

No thrills. Just neuroscience. If you are a student or an amateur scientist yearning to get your start in neuroscience, this is for you. Perhaps you\'re a teacher in need of an affordable, exciting, and in-depth educational tool to make learning neuroscience fun for kids or young adults. You could even be looking for a competition-destroying science fair project. Whatever your neuroscience need, the Neuron Spikerbox Classic is here to fill it! The Neuron SpikerBox is a bioamplifier that allows you to hear and see real-time electrical \\"spikes\\", or action potentials, of live neurons in invertebrates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devicesmd/NeuronSpikerBoxPro":{"id":"devicesmd/NeuronSpikerBoxPro","title":"Neuron SpikerBox Pro","description":"|Technical Specifications||","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devicesmd/PlantSpikerBox":{"id":"devicesmd/PlantSpikerBox","title":"Plant SpikerBox","description":"Our Plant Spikerbox allows you to perform data-driven experiments between various species of plants!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"devicesmd/ReactionTimer":{"id":"devicesmd/ReactionTimer","title":"Reaction Timer","description":"Please Note: Requires a Human SpikerBox and a USB connection to an Android device, Mac, PC Desktop or iPhone/iPad with USB-C connector.
